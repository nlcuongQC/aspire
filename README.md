# Aspire QA Challenge
I used Cucumber version 6.8.1 and Selenium 2.53.1

Let run this command to testing

`mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @register" verify`

I can't do the verify step (the last step) so I ignored it

You can check the report in reports/cucumber-reporting

Check my feature file to get the flow of testing
